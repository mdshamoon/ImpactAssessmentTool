Project: Impact Assessment Tool

“Impact Assessment Tool” is an analytics tool developed by ColoredCow to help NGOs to measure the impact of their work through data collection and analysis. It allows a social enterprise or an NGO to capture data of their groundwork, get feedback from the beneficiaries (people who get benefited from NGO’s work), and other important data for analysis.
Once an NGO   this data, it then shares it with other organizations/corporates who have funded them. This helps the funders to verify their money is getting invested properly. It also allows NGOs to get more funds if data and analysis prove that they are really doing good.

Project Goal
The NGO team goes to remote areas to conduct their work and they generally don’t have any internet connection. The Impact Assessment Tool is a web-based application and requires an internet connection to retrieve/submit assessment data. We need to enable NGO teams to be able to submit data when they are offline and once they’re online, the data gets synced automatically.
